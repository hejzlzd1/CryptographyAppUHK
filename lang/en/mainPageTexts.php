Depending on the algorithm used, the resulting text should be meaningless or directly unreadable to a subject who does not know the auxiliary information to decrypt it. This process is carried out according to predefined rules or by means of a chosen algorithm. An example of the resulting encryption product may be a random mixture of numbers, letters, words or nonsense sentences.',

An essential part of this is the design of encryption and decryption keys used in encryption algorithms and their possible internal calculations.',
